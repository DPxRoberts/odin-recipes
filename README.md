# The Odin Project – Odin’s Recipes

This project is one of the first assignments in **The Odin Project Foundations Course**. It tests the foundational HTML skills I’ve learned so far by having me build a basic multi-page website.

The goal of the project is to create a simple HTML website with an `index.html` page that links to three individual recipe pages. Each page focuses on practicing proper structure and semantic HTML.

Throughout this project, I worked with **ordered lists (`ol`)**, **unordered lists (`ul`)**, and **list items (`li`)** to build out the recipe content. I also learned how to use **heading elements** correctly to create a clear content hierarchy, making the pages more readable and structured.

Additionally, I practiced using **image elements**, including setting `alt` text and adjusting `width` and `height` attributes to properly display images on the page.

Overall, this project was an eye-opening experience that helped reinforce the core building blocks of web development and gave me a solid understanding of the basic structure of a website using HTML alone.
