        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>French Macarons are elegantly delicate sandwich cookies with a light, crisp shell and a soft, chewy interior. Primarily made from almond flour, egg whites, and sugar, these meringue-based treats are finished by piping your choice of buttercream, ganache, or jam between two shells to create the perfect sandwich. </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 egg whites</li>
            <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 ⅔ cups confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup finely ground almonds</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Direction</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat.</li>
            <li>Beat egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment until foamy. Add white sugar and beat until egg whites are glossy, fluffy, and hold soft peaks. </li>
            <li>Sift confectioners' sugar and ground almonds in a separate bowl; quickly fold almond mixture into egg whites, about 30 strokes. </li>
            <li>Spoon a small amount of batter into a plastic bag with a small corner cut off and pipe a test disk of batter, about 1 1/2 inches in diameter, onto the prepared baking sheet. If the disk of batter holds a peak instead of flattening immediately, gently fold batter a few more times and retest.</li>
            <li>When batter is mixed enough to flatten immediately into an even disk, spoon into a pastry bag fitted with a plain round tip. Pipe batter onto the baking sheet in rounds, leaving space between the disks. Let piped cookies stand out at room temperature until they form a hard skin on top, about 1 hour. </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 285 degrees F (140 degrees C). </li>
            <li>Bake cookies in preheated oven until set but not browned, about 10 minutes. </li>
            <li>Let cookies cool completely before filling, about 30 minutes. </li>
        </ol>
