        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These Chocolate Chip Cookies are the ultimate study in contrasting textures: they feature perfectly crisp,
            golden edges with a soft, gooey center. Every bite is loaded with melty chocolate pockets and rich notes of
            caramelized brown sugar, butter, and vanilla. <br> Whether you like them warm from the oven or saved for an
            afternoon snack, these cookies offer that classic, nostalgic flavor with a sophisticated, chewy finish.</p>

            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons hot water</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped walnuts (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Direction</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather your ingredients, making sure your butter is softened, and your eggs are room temperature. </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat butter, white sugar, and brown sugar in a large
                bowl with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>Beat in eggs, one at a time, then stir in vanilla. </li>
            <li>Dissolve baking soda in hot water; add to batter along with salt and mix until combined. </li>
            <li>Stir in flour, chocolate chips, and walnuts until a soft dough forms. </li>
            <li>Drop rounded spoonfuls of cookie dough 2 inches apart onto un-greased baking sheets. </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are lightly browned, about 10 minutes. </li>
            <li>Cool on the baking sheets briefly before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. </li>
            <li>Store in an airtight container or serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
